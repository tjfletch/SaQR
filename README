# Project Title

Our project is designed to give everybody the necessary tools to easy market their business, themselves, or any information they desire. The basis of the business is to more easily provide access to QR CODE generation and presentation. Save time from traditional information swapping and scan the tool as designed by the party you wish to meet.

## Getting Started

Open the app to either manage, create, or scan. 1) Manage your profile and 'QR Toolbox'; 2) Create new QR codes; 3) Open 'Scan' feature to get connected with another user.

### Prerequisites

Install application from Apple Store (iOS) or Android Marketplace (Droid)

```
Give examples
```

'''### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo'''

## Running the tests

Python Debugging tool to ensure user codes generate and assign to each user correctly. User ID reports back QR code ID's...QR Code ID's return User ID. Track chain of connections - similar to 'friends' or 'connections' on social media platforms

### Break down into end to end tests

Test strength of database and ensure mapping is successful

```
Give an example
```
User 000909808909 -- report (18) QR Code ID's 
USER 000909808909 -- QR 2848481039 -- [Date, time] of entry
USER 000909808909 -- QR 12123123123 -- [Date, time] of entry
USER 000909808909 -- QR 121r345423 -- [Date, time] of entry
USER 000909808909 -- QR 233452313 -- [Date, time] of entry
...........................................................





### And coding style tests

Standard Quality Control and Assurance practices...not sure here

```
Give an example
```
